HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. 
This bot is based off a plugin pm2 and it is needed for the bot to work. Open a terminal and type the following. "npm pm2 -g"
The ENV file must be filled to the best of your ability. Leave the Sever realted stuff blank.

If you would like a fivem server status, make sure to fill out the env to the best of your ability. The Variable SERVERIP must include the full up with the port. IE: 0.0.0.0:30120
SERVERIP2 can be the same without the port. And server port, just put in the port. If there are any questions. Send Bombo43453#1901 A friend request on discord and he can help.
To connect your own mongoose database, just find the login link and then put it under the database folder then on the mongoose file. 

To have the fivem server status to work. Go under events, and then delete the file ready and keep ready1. In the code of ready one, un slash the part the says to.
